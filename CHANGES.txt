zope.security Package Changelog
===============================

zope.security version 3.2.0 (2006/01/05)
----------------------------------------

Corresponds to the verison of the zope.security package shipped as part of
the Zope 3.2.0 release.

Removed deprecated helper functions, 'proxy.trustedRemoveSecurityProxy'
and 'proxy.getProxiedObject'.

Made handling of 'management.{end,restore}Interaction' more careful
w.r.t. edge cases.

Made behavior of 'canWrite' consistent with 'canAccess':  if 'canAccess'
does not raise 'ForbiddenAttribute', then neither will 'canWrite'.  See:
http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope3-dev/506

Code style / documentation / test fixes.

zope.security version 3.1.0 (2005/10/03)
----------------------------------------

Added support for use of the new Python 2.4 datatypes, 'set' and
'frozenset', within checked code.

C security proxy acquired a dependency on the 'proxy.h' header from the
'zope.proxy' package.
  
XXX: the spelling of the '#include' is bizarre!  It seems to be related
to 'zpkg'-based builds, and should likely be revisited.  For the
moment, I have linked in the 'zope.proxy' package into our own
'include' directory.  See the subversion checkin:
http://svn.zope.org/Zope3/?rev=37882&view=rev

Updated checker to avoid re-proxying objects which have and explicit
'__Security_checker__' assigned.

Corresponds to the verison of the zope.security package shipped as part of
the Zope 3.1.0 release.

Clarified contract of 'IChecker' to indicate that its 'check*' methods
may raise only 'Forbidden' or 'Unauthorized' exceptions.

Added interfaces, ('IPrincipal', 'IGroupAwarePrincipal', 'IGroup', and
'IPermission') specifying contracts of components in the security framework.

Code style / documentation / test fixes.

zope.security version 3.0.0 (2004/11/07)
