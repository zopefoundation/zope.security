3.6.0 - unreleased
------------------

- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.


3.5.2 - 2008-07-27
------------------

- Made C code compatible with Python 2.5 on 64bit architectures.


3.5.1 - 2008-06-04
-------------------

- Add `frozenset`, `set`, `reversed`, and `sorted` to the list of safe
  builtins.


3.5.0 - 2008-03-05
-------------------

- Changed title for ``zope.security.management.system_user`` to be more
  presentable.


3.4.0 - 2007/10/02
------------------

- Updated meta-data.


3.4.0b5 - 2007/08/15
--------------------

- Bug: Fixed a circular import in the C implementation.


3.4.0b4 - 2007/08/14
--------------------

- Bug: ``zope.security.management.system_user`` had an ugly/brittle id.


3.4.0b3 - 2007/08/14
--------------------

- ``zope.security`` now works on Python 2.5

- Bug: ``zope.security.management.system_user`` wasn't a valid principal
  (didn't provide IPrincipal).

- Bug: Fixed inclusion of doctest to use the doctest module from
  ``zope.testing``. Now tests can be run multiple times without
  breaking. (#98250)


3.4.0b2 - 2007/06/15
--------------------

- Bug: Removed stack extraction in newInteraction. When using eggs this is an
  extremly expensive function. The publisher is now more than 10 times faster
  when using eggs and about twice as fast with a zope trunk checkout.


3.4.0b1
-------

- Temporarily fixed the hidden (and accidental) dependency on zope.testing to
  become optional.

Note: The releases between 3.2.0 and 3.4.0b1 where not tracked as an
individual package and have been documented in the Zope 3 changelog.


3.2.0 - 2006/01/05
------------------

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.security package shipped as part of
  the Zope 3.2.0 release.

- Removed deprecated helper functions, 'proxy.trustedRemoveSecurityProxy' and
  'proxy.getProxiedObject'.

- Made handling of 'management.{end,restore}Interaction' more careful w.r.t.
  edge cases.

- Made behavior of 'canWrite' consistent with 'canAccess':  if 'canAccess'
  does not raise 'ForbiddenAttribute', then neither will 'canWrite'.  See:
  http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope3-dev/506

- Code style / documentation / test fixes.


3.1.0 - 2005/10/03
------------------

- Added support for use of the new Python 2.4 datatypes, 'set' and
  'frozenset', within checked code.

- C security proxy acquired a dependency on the 'proxy.h' header from the
  'zope.proxy' package.

- XXX: the spelling of the '#include' is bizarre!  It seems to be related to
  'zpkg'-based builds, and should likely be revisited.  For the moment, I have
  linked in the 'zope.proxy' package into our own 'include' directory.  See
  the subversion checkin: http://svn.zope.org/Zope3/?rev=37882&view=rev

- Updated checker to avoid re-proxying objects which have and explicit
  '__Security_checker__' assigned.

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.security package shipped as part of
  the Zope 3.1.0 release.

- Clarified contract of 'IChecker' to indicate that its 'check*' methods may
  raise only 'Forbidden' or 'Unauthorized' exceptions.

- Added interfaces, ('IPrincipal', 'IGroupAwarePrincipal', 'IGroup', and
  'IPermission') specifying contracts of components in the security framework.

- Code style / documentation / test fixes.


3.0.0 - 2004/11/07
------------------

- Corresponds to the version of the zope.security package shipped as part of
  the Zope X3.0.0 release.
